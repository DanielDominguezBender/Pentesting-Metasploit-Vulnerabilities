# Pentesting-Metasploit-Vulnerabilities  

Exploiting vulnerabilities in Metasploitable

<b>What I want to achieve?</b>

I want to see if I’m able to search and find any vulnerability on a mestasploitable machine and exploit it.

<b>How I will achieve it?</b>

In order to achieve this, I will follow some of the steps I’ve learned during my Master Degree studies, such as fingerpinting the metasploitable machine, scanning the network/ports.

<b>Procedure:</b>

I launched a port scanning using NMAP. The scanning was done from the Kali Linux machine to the IP of the metasploitable VM.
Below you will see on the left side the KALI machine and on the right the Metasploitable.

Here a detail of the report of the nmap scan.

```

I see following opened port (21) that can be interesting:
```
PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
21/tcp    open  ftp         vsftpd 2.3.4
```
Double checking with Metasploit:














I see that port 21 is open, it’s an FTP service  with the following version VSFTPD 2.3.4.
Let’s see if there are any vulnerabilities related. Making a quick search in Metasploit I can find a backdoor.


















Checking in CVEDETAILS I can see more information.
This vulnerability opens a shell on port 6200/tcp.
Let’s try this :)

I will use the exploit that I could see earlier: 

exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor

Now let me see the related payloads.



After setting the payload I check the available options.



Remote Port (RPORT) is already set to the one I’m interesting at: 21
Now let’s config the remote host (RHOSTS).



Final step … exploit the machine <evil face>.


As shown on the terminal, a SHELL has been found, seems to be a SUCCESS!!
Let’s see if I can see anything from the attacked machine using the remote shell. I will start by typing some simple commands like: pwd, whoami and ls

On the left side it shows the output on the Kali machine while on the right the terminal output of the metasploitable machine.

pwd: show that I’m at root directory

whoami: show that I’m root

ls -la: show the files and folders that are visible on the root directory


I will try to navigate to some folder and get more information.



I can navigate to folder “home/user” and read a file with cat command.
